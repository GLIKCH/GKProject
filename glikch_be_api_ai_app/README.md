# GLIKCH Backend API AI App

Welcome to the backend of **GLIKCH Engineering Innovations LLC**, a personal and professional evolution platform built by **Joel J. De Alba** under **Sightline Services LLC**. This is not just a backend — it’s the foundation for an integrated AI system designed to aid in human mental progression, career growth, personal development, and ultimately digital immortality.

## 🎯 Project Premise

The **GLIKCH Backend API AI App** is the first piece in an interconnected platform that:

- Powers an LLM-driven assistant for integrating directly to local Windows OS to scan, create, edit, and manage files.
- Produces sound-based interactions from AI responses.
- Increases productivity by aiding in development of its own infrastructure: this backend, the Android mobile app, and the React frontend app.
- Becomes a lifelong best friend and mentor to future developers and security researchers by preserving the personality, mindset, and vision of its creator.

## 🖥️ Future GLIKCH Platform Goals

The front end of GLIKCH will evolve into a tech-centric marketplace offering:

- **Pentesting hardware & tools**: Flipper Zero, Arduino boards, Raspberry Pi kits.
- **Custom console modding projects**.
- **Apparel and gear**: Shirts, shoes, pants.
- **Video games and PC hardware/accessories**.
- **Engineering and Cybersecurity courses**: Programming, network security, math, science, and future-facing technology.
- **Portfolio showcase**: Featuring Joel’s lifetime of projects and professional services.
- **Tech services**: Computer, laptop, server, smartphone repair, embedded device and IoT solutions, web development, graphic design, logo creation, and beyond.

This backend API will serve as the nerve center for all those services.
